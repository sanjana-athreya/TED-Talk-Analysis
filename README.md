# TED Talk Analysis
TED is a  nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages.

Given its recent popularity, there are numerous events being organised for TED talk and conferences and there are more than 3000 TED Talks currently available on internet. 

A detailed analysis of the talks would be a lot helpful to the current speakers, potential speakers and to all the viewers interested in listening to some quality talks. 

Our project aims at :
- Providing detailed analysis on which TED Talks have larger number of views, which talks create maximum debate.
- Insights on the trending topics by analysing which topic and which tags get the maximum views, comments and ratings.
- Building a predictive model to analyse which video will get more views.

The dataset that has been used for performing exploratory and predictive data analysis has been web scrapped from the official TED Talks website, www.ted.com

The analysis will be performed using two data sets. 
- TED_Main : This dataset contains all the details of the TED Talks like the Title of the TED talk, Speaker's name, Speaker's Occupation, Duration, Ratings, Comments, Views, etc. 
- Transcripts : This data set contains the content of the speech in textual format.
